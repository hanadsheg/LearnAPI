# 🌦️ API Practice Projects

Welcome to my collection of API-based projects! This repository showcases hands-on experiments and mini-projects where I learn and demonstrate how to interact with APIs using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## 📌 Project: Weather App

This weather application allows users to search for real-time weather information by entering a city name. It utilizes the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch current weather data and display it in a styled, responsive interface.

### 🧠 Purpose

- Strengthen understanding of **REST APIs**
- Learn **asynchronous JavaScript** (using `async/await` and `fetch`)
- Practice **DOM manipulation**
- Implement responsive **UI design** using HTML & CSS

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for structure  
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – for API calls and interactivity  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – data provider
